### Node-Hill Template

### Installation:

1. Download Node.js 8 or above at https://nodejs.org/en/download/

2. Download and extract the code from this repository

3. Open the extracted folder in the file explorer, and in the top bar type "cmd" and press enter.

4. Run `npm i node-hill@latest`, as this will install the needed dependencies for node-hill to function.

5. Edit the `start.js` file to fill in your appropriate server information. \
You will need to add your host key for the set you want to host. This can be found under the set's settings page.

6. Finally, start your server by running `npm start` on your command prompt.

### Additional information
You __must__ port forward if you want other players to be able to play your game. The recommended port for Brick Hill is: 42480.
You are able to bundle your map/scripts into a single .bbrk file by launching your server with the --bundle option. 
For example: `node .\start.js --bundle`
For more information on bundling check out [nh-bundle](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nh-bundle).
